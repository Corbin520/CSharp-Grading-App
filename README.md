# CSharp-Grading-App
{ Video Will be Added when completed }


This C# Application will be used for grading. It is a console application

What I will be doing in this application:


* Writing a grading application that will take in grades, compute the
    average grade, low grade and high grade.

* Unit Testing to Check My Code


What I learned from this application.
* this is my first time using C# and .NET. So herea a the things iv learned:
    - Unit Testing
    - Working with Classes and Objects
    - Reference Types & Value Types
    - Building Types
    - Using Statements, Methods & Constructors
    - Static, Public and Private members
    - .NET Runtime and 



* UPDATE 11/25/2019
{
    Working more into the application, i learned more testing and how
    to pass reference types, and value types to eachother.
}
* UPDATE 11/26/2019
{
    Added the user input so that the user can enter in grades as well
    as type in "q" to quit. Once a user quits the program, it will display
    the average, high and low grade. I also added some throw and catch
    so that I can throw and error and catch an error if the user puts in
    incorrect format.
}

* UPDATE 11/27/2019
{
    In the course today, I learned how to build types, getters, setters
    and members
