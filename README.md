durring this course.

    - Unit Testing
    - Working with Classes and Objects
    - Reference Types & Value Types
    - Building Types
    - Using Statements, Methods & Constructors
    - Static, Public and Private members
    - .NET Runtime and 
    - Gettes & Setters
    - Building Types

Overall, this was very fun and challanging. I look forward to building more C# applications
